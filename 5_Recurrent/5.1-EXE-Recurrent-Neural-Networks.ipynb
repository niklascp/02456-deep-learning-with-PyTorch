In the context of natural language processing a token could be a character or a word, but mind you that the concepts introduced here apply to all kinds of sequential data, such as e.g. protein sequences, weather measurements, audio signals or monetary transaction history, just to name a few.\n",

    "With time sequences our data can be represented as $x \\in \\mathrm{R}^{t \\, \\times \\, d}$, where $t$ is the sequence length. \n",
    "This emphasises sequence dependence and that the samples along the sequence are not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).\n",

    "There are several ways to represent sequences. With text, the challenge is how to represent a word as a feature vector in $d$ dimensions, as we are required to represent text with decimal numbers in order to apply neural networks to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will use a simple one-hot encoding but for categorical variables that can take on many values (e.g. words in the English language) this may be infeasible. For such scenarios, you can project the encodings into a smaller space by use of embeddings. If you want to learn more about tokens, encodings and embeddings than what is covered in this exercise, we highly recommend [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEMJRjEdNzM&list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z)."

This for instance helped identify, that you should not backpropergate into the first instance of t = 0, e.g. I made a condition that improved the training:\n",

To combat these issues the gated hidden units were created. The two most prominent gated hidden units are the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), both of which have shown increased performance in saving and reusing memory in later timesteps. In this exercise, we will focus on LSTM but you would easily be able to go ahead and implement the GRU as well based on the principles that you learn here.\n",

    "**Answer**: As seen above we achive a loss well below 1.0 (0.72). The sequence is predicted well, but the shift from a to b is delayed one itereation witch is typical for LSTMs.\n",
    "- 1) About the loss and number of epochs compared to the vanilla RNN we see much faster learning, e.g. loss is droping much faster.\n",
    "- 2) We can use a higher learning rate for the LSTM because we have a larger number of weights to approximate. "

    "Compare your loss to the numpy implementation. Are they similar? Try to play around with the hyper-parameters and hidden dimensions. How low of a negative log-likelihood can you achieve?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: As seen above we achive a loss well below 1.0 (0.29 after 45 epochs). The sequence is predicted well, but the shift from a to b is delayed one itereation witch is typical for LSTMs.\n",
    "- 1) Comparing the loss between the numpy and PyTorch implementations we see very similar shapes of learning curves. However the PyTouch version get to a lower NLL both faster and overall.\n",
    "- 2) Playing with huperparameters (see below) we can cannot get a lower NLL than 0.29. Different tries has been made including incresing the number of hidden units to 200, adding a additional LSTM layer and incresing the number of epochs."

    "As we have already seen, RNNs are excellent for sequential data such as language. But what do we do if we're modelling data with strong dependency in both directions? Like in many things deep learning, we can build powerful models by stacking layers on top of each other: *bi-directional* RNNs consist of two LSTM cells, one for each direction. A sequence is first fed into the forward LSTM cell and the reversed sequence is then used as input to the backward LSTM cell together with the last hidden state from the forward LSTM cell. Follow [this link](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4b80/89bc9b49f84de43acc2eb8900035f7d492b2.pdf) for the original paper from 1997(!).\n",
